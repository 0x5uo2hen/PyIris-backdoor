# Python Iris (PyIris)
PyIris is a toolkit used in order to gain remote access, utilising payloads that connect back to a command and control server. The 
payloads that PyIris utilises can evade antivirus, firewalls and user detection while giving you complete control over the victim's 
computer.

The toolkit's payloads focuses on robustness, stealth, and functionality. This means that you can gain and maintain access without 
worrying about AV/Firewall detection all while having an artificial shell. Why is the payload referred to as an artificial shell? Aside 
from being just a standard shell, PyIris offers much more, it layers on built in features not attainable in your standard reverse shell.
