# Python Iris (PyIris)
A Windows backdoor complete with its own command and control server. Utilising reverse TCP connections and python scripting, when converted
to a windows executable with pyinstaller or any other tool, the backdoor payloads can effectively avoid antivirus, firewalls and remain
stealthy without user detection.
