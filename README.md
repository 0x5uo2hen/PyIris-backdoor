# Python Iris (PyIris)
A series of backdoor payloads complete with their own command and control server. Utilising reverse TCP connections and python scripting, when 
converted
to system executables with pyinstaller or any other tool, the backdoor payloads can effectively avoid antivirus, firewalls and remain
stealthy without user detection.
